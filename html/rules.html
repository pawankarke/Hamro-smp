            <li>Keep names and profile pictures appropriate. Profiles with inappropriate avatars and usernames are not allowed. Usernames that are against the rules, NSFW, hard to mention, or containing special characters will be changed without warning.</li>
            <li>Be respectful. Refrain from discussing extremist politics, racism, sexism, religious hatred, and try to keep political discussion to a minimum. No flaming (insulting, abusing, or harassing other members) will be tolerated. Keep this a safe environment for everyone.</li>
            <li>Don't spam the chat. Avoid excessive and unnecessary messages, caps, emojis, text walls, spoiler messages, and images. Keep all your conversations in English/Hindi, and only English characters are permitted.</li>
            <li>Do not try to impersonate anyone. Don't try to fake your identity, gender, or impersonate other users by changing usernames or by any other possible way.</li>
            <li>Don't be an annoyance in voice channels. Do not queue NSFW noises, ear rape, or disturb others in any way in voice channels. Make sure you notify everyone that you intend to record the conversation and wait for everyone's consent before you do so.</li>
            <li>No useless pings. No useless role or user pings. Do not ping SAMBOT staff or any member if they aren't actively interacting in the chat.</li>
